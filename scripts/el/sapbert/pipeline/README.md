# The Entity Linking Pipeline

- sapbert in "models" dir
- dataset in "datasets" dir
- running it in the di cluster vs running it locally
- remember config

- test by downloading all the datasets, and put the evaluation libraries not in the datasets folder, but in a evaluation folder (and the build_el_test_file_reference_tsvs.py can go to the utils dir)
